# Patient Registry System

A simple patient registry system for managing patient records. This project is part of CSCI 4490 Software Engineering class activities.

## Features

- Register new patients with auto-generated unique IDs
- Retrieve patient information by ID
- View all registered patients
- Input validation and error handling

## Files

- `patient_registry.py` - Core PatientRegistry class
- `test_patient.py` - Unit tests
- `main.py` - Interactive menu application

## Usage

Run the application:
```bash
python main.py
```

The application will run unit tests first, then provide an interactive menu to:
1. Register a new patient
2. Retrieve patient information
3. Print all registered patients
4. Exit

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Testing

Unit tests are included and run automatically when executing `main.py`. To run tests separately:
```bash
python test_patient.py
```
